Hello, so now i'm going to show you the prototype of the Privacy Notices Generator. It's a fake app, a draft MVP from which i'm working to build the real one. The idea was to imagine to workflow and the process, and iterate on it until something fine.

So each input is checked in in advance, let's go.

The authenticate step is necessry for analytics. I need it store the data from the user and improve the app.

Each input has his own flow.

Here you have some hint that give you information.

If I click on this input, I have more options to choose before to be redirected to the normal flow.
